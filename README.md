### ML_Logger

ML_Logger is a set of scripts (for now) developed to simplify logging procedures during data analysis, modeling and other related tasks.

*Warning:* At this point of time only two decorators `@log_model(path)` and `@log_params(path)` are working correctly.

It is intetion of the author to build robust and easy to use tools to record model mertics, parameters, hyperparameters, key data transformations, etc. If you have any suggestion how to improve it or would like to contribute feel free to do so.
